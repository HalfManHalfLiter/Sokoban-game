Sokoban Game
This is a C++ console-based implementation of the classic Sokoban puzzle game. The player controls a warehouse worker (@) who must push boxes (X) onto target locations (?) within a limited number of moves. The game features four levels of increasing difficulty, an ASCII art interface, and a menu system for navigation.
Project Structure

src/ - Source code:
sokoban.cpp: Main program with game logic, including menu, levels, and movement mechanics.


.gitignore: Excludes unnecessary files (e.g., compiled binaries).
README.md: This file.

Features

Four Levels: Progress through four unique levels with different map layouts and challenges.
ASCII Art Interface: Menu and game screens use ASCII art for a retro aesthetic.
Movement Mechanics: Use W, A, S, D to move the worker and push boxes, and Q to return to the menu.
Win/Lose Conditions: Win by placing all boxes on targets, or lose if moves run out.
Level Progression: Automatically advance to the next level upon completion.

Requirements

C++ compiler (e.g., g++, MinGW, or Visual Studio)
Windows operating system (due to use of <conio.h> and system("cls"))

How to Run

Operacja: 


Move the worker (@) to push boxes (X) onto targets (?).
Win by placing both boxes on targets within the move limit.

Limitations

The game uses <conio.h> for input handling (_getch), which is Windows-specific. For cross-platform compatibility, consider replacing _getch with standard C++ input methods.
No save/load functionality; progress is not persisted.
Limited error handling for invalid inputs.
